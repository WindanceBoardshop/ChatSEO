<p><span data-mce-fragment=""1"">The Foil Drive Assist Slim is perfectly suited to those just looking for an extra boost to get on foil or to ride smaller boards and foils. The Assist Slim is not suitable for prolongated periods of motor assisted riding, it simply provides the boost to get up on foil and ride more. Advanced Surf and Downwind riders will love the low profile and weight but will need to be very disciplined on the throttle usage. Wing foilers simple do not need the run time usually and will also appreciate the low profile and weight. </span></p>

<p><span>Designed to increase low end thrust, </span><span>the Three Blade Propeller Hub is an optional upgrade for Foil Drive Assist PLUS units, a game changer for riders pushing the limits of rider weight, board size and foil size.</span></p>
<p><span><br></span><span data-mce-fragment=""1"">When compared to the standard </span><span data-mce-fragment=""1"">Two </span><span data-mce-fragment=""1"">Blade Propeller system, the NEW Three Blade Propeller system improves performance by:</span><br></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Increased low end thrust</span></li>
<li><span>More torque at lower RPM, avoiding propeller cavitation under high load</span></li>
<li><span>More effective surface driving when the props breach the surface</span></li>
<li><span>A smoother, quieter ride</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>It is specifically designed for riders who require more low end torque, whether this is due to using a low volume board, a smaller or higher aspect foil than normal, or being a heavier rider. </span></p>
<p><span>We do not recommend using the Three Blade Propeller Hub for prolonged efoiling at full throttle as this will drain your battery much quicker, and could cause the electronics to overheat and enter thermal protection mode.</span><b></b></p>
<p><b>Note:</b></p>
<p><span>- Not compatible with Foil Drive Assist. While they do fit, these propellers require the higher RMP of the Assist PLUS in order to improve performance.</span></p>
<p><span>-Three Blade Propeller Hubs must be used with three propellers! </span></p>

<p><span style=""color: #ff8000;""><strong>Note for Existing Propellers: </strong>If you have any damage to your propellers, we recommend you consider the full set with three fresh, balanced propellers. Unbalanced propellers may cause vibration and damage to your system.</span><br></p>

<p>When using the Parallel Y Lead, it's very important to ensure you:</p>
<p>- Only ever connect 2x Small 4.2ah Batteries together.<br>- Both batteries must be fully charged 100% when connected.

Charge each battery 100% before re-connecting.<br>- When flying on airlines, all batteries must be disconnected and carried/packed appropriately<br>- No flatwater foiling allowed. You will simply drain your batteries too fast and degrade them much faster over time.</p>

<p>You must apply 2 strips of electrical tape down the shaft of your paddle before installation. This is both to protect the surface, and to create a softer surface to the clamping force of the mount to grip to. The bolts only requiring finger tight tension to remain in position.<br></p>

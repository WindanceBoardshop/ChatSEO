<p>Engineered for aerodynamic efficiency, with balanced stability and deformation resistance for maximum speed and range, high wind advantage and light wind performance. The design is the result of complex proprietary computer simulations.<br>
<br>
Please note: The 19m is Mens Formula Kite Class only. The 21m is not approved for Formula Kite Class<br>
<br>
“Our North Formula kite design is super light, extremely stable, and has a slightly different bridling system, refined to deliver speed and performance to the far edge of fast. We’re proud to celebrate our sailing heritage and join the other North Sails classes dominating the worldwide racing podiums.”  — Mike Raper, North Brand Director.</p>

Engineered with a stable, lower aspect ratio design for fast pivot turns and excellent drift, the Carve has an extremely direct feel in both bar pressure and steering initiation. Intuitive control—especially when the kite's not visible on a big bottom turn, cutback, or barrel—means you can focus 100% on the surf. The Carve has a longer, progressive travel, so it feels smooth and responsive throughout the full depower range and is reactive to the very end when you sheet out. For 2025, we’ve refined the 2025 Carve bridling for increased depower and responsive feather-light steering, so the Carve feels lighter, faster turning and more agile. You’ll also discover a cleaner, more aerodynamic canopy profile, with lighter bar pressure for more stable efficient drifting and less pull on the wave face. The improved overall balance with more sweep in the tips enhances drift, so when you're surfing, it glides down the line, waiting for your bar input. The wingtips are light, and the smooth curve and shape draft back ensures balance. A thinner LE diameter reduces the pulling power, while added sweep enables effortless roll to relaunch. The 2025 Carve is smoother, more stable and manageable in gusty conditions. The Carve flies fast upwind and experienced riders will benefit from the kite's impressive power and efficiency.

The super-stiff airframe transfers wind energy into greater forward speed, with explosive boost and hangtime. The high-tenacity canopy complements the increased airframe tension, increasing the wind range and shape-hold in all conditions. For 2025, we’ve introduced the ShiftLock modular track mounting system, for custom positioning of any size ShiftLock carbon handle or boom. The Mode Pro now features anti-deflection Carbon UDi Technology inside the LE for a faster, more direct response. The wing’s profile sections are thinner up front, with increased depth in the centre for added high-speed performance in a wider wind range. We’ve created a cleaner canopy with new radial geometric panel cuts and load diffusers. These work in harmony to distribute tension more evenly in defined load directions across the canopy and improve aerodynamic flow. We designed the Mode Pro primarily for speed, but the stiffer airframe also translates into unprecedented loft for higher jumps and forward momentum on landings. With incredible high-end stability, the 3.5 and 4.2m are ideal for use in stronger winds, while the 4.8 to 6.5m are optimised for greater power in lighter air. The wing has a balanced lower aspect ratio with rounded wingtips to reduce tip strike.<br>

The super-stiff airframe transfers wind energy into greater forward speed, with explosive boost and hangtime. The high-tenacity canopy complements the increased airframe tension, increasing the wind range and shape-hold in all conditions. For 2025, we’ve introduced the ShiftLock modular track mounting system, for custom positioning of any size ShiftLock carbon handle or boom. The Mode Pro now features anti-deflection Carbon UDi Technology inside the LE for a faster, more direct response. The wing’s profile sections are thinner up front, with increased depth in the centre for added high-speed performance in a wider wind range. We’ve created a cleaner canopy with new radial geometric panel cuts and load diffusers. These work in harmony to distribute tension more evenly in defined load directions across the canopy and improve aerodynamic flow. We designed the Mode Pro primarily for speed, but the stiffer airframe also translates into unprecedented loft for higher jumps and forward momentum on landings. With incredible high-end stability, the 3.5 and 4.2m are ideal for use in stronger winds, while the 4.8 to 6.5m are optimised for greater power in lighter air.

The Aluminium is our alternative to the Carbon, with the same innovative features. The loop-loop-go system makes rigging simple and seamless, even on the downhaul. The low-stretch Dyneema rope greatly reduces friction, and downhaul can be applied with just your hands on most Wave and X-Over sails. The extension ring has a simple to use Pop &amp; Slide system, so setting the right length becomes intuitive. The U-Pin button sits discreetly on the extension tube and has a manual locking function for safety and peace of mind, whether you’re in the waves or during long slalom reaches. High-grade plastic and stainless steel components ensure the extension will be in your quiver for many years to come.</p>

The new S192 has effortless glide and is fast and agile. When paired with bigger downwind front wings, an intermediate rider will find it super stable and easy to pump. The S192 also pumps efficiently with the SF and the new Pump Front Wings.

We’ve reshaped the new 2025 Atmos, giving it a balanced flex pattern for responsive and dynamic load and release, with precise edge control for powerful upwind tracking. Strategically placed layers of unidirectional carbon tape in the Triaxial Hybrid Carbon construction help deliver a well-balanced dynamic flex. The Atmos rides overpowered with ease and control yet still enables early planing and low-end performance. The harmony between medium rocker, progressive outline, and flex makes this the ultimate board to take you to the next level in all conditions.

We’ve built the 2025 Astra with a responsive flex for riders with a smaller build, delivering increased control in a range of conditions, greater comfort, and softer landings - without sacrificing performance.  The new Astra's smaller proportions, narrower stance, and lightweight biaxial hybrid carbon construction with 3DY reinforcement provide riders of all levels with just the right amount of flex for controlled edging, boosts, and loops. Its consistent, dependable rail grip gives you extra confidence to push boundaries as you load up for massive jumps. With its super-efficient bottom shape and rocker, the board feels fast through the water and flies upwind. The medium flex is dense enough to deliver clean and powerful pop, yet soft enough to forgive your knees and legs on harder landings.

For 2024 we’ve revised the bridle and further improved TE tensioning for a smoother, more efficient design with responsive power delivery in all conditions. Borrowed from our North sailing heritage, Code Zero is the name of a sail born to go fast in light, shifty conditions. Like its namesake, we engineered this kite for performance in very light air. The Code Zero is a light, fast and reactive single-strut performer with effortless one-handed control and efficient light wind power delivery. It flies and turns quickly - with excellent drift and manoeuvrability which makes it ideal for foiling and small surf. One of the lightest single-strut kites available, the Code Zero has a playful and agile feel with dynamic steering. Refined for weight savings, we’ve stripped back the kite’s construction to the essential, using lighter N-Max Dacron on the leading edge and strut for stiffness and durability, a double-canopy layer to reinforce the trailing edge and lighter-weight bladder material in every size. Super fun and easy to fly, with intuitive relaunch and reverse launch, the Code Zero is also great for learning to kite or foil in light winds. The kite is stable and evenly tensioned, with a balanced geometry. For 2024 we’ve updated the Code Zero with a newly revised bridle for a more rigid feel, lighter bar pressure, more direct steering response and added stability. We’ve optimised the angle of attack in the wingtip and improved the tension in the trailing edge for smoother aerodynamics and reduced flutter. And we’ve introduced three new sizes to the range: 6, 8 and 10m. The Code Zero is a highly efficient kite with a wide wind range and impressive power delivery for a one-strut kite – so you can ride lighter wind conditions with a smaller kite.</p>

We’ve optimised the angle of attack in the wingtip and improved the tension in the trailing edge for smoother aerodynamics and reduced flutter. And we’ve introduced three new sizes to the range: 6, 8 and 10m. The Code Zero is a highly efficient kite with a wide wind range and impressive power delivery for a one-strut kite – so you can ride lighter wind conditions with a smaller kite.</p>

We’ve reduced the thickness of the submerged portion of our new High Modulus Prepreg Carbon masts by over 15% compared to our standard Carbon masts, while also increasing both bending and torsional stiffness. The HM80 favours disciplines without wind power - prone surf, pump and downwind. The shorter chord length over the entire mast length reduces drag and increases manoeuvrability. This delivers more glide, more efficient pumping, and quicker turns. The HM85 covers all disciplines, with a focus on wing-foiling. Wind-powered disciplines require edging against the wind to create forward drive. Some of this drive comes from the front wing, and some comes from the mast. To efficiently provide this drive, the chord length in the submerged part of the mast is slightly longer. It increases near the top of the mast to maximise stiffness with no drag penalty, as this part of the mast is clear of the water once on foil. A more efficient underwater body shape means less drag and, hence, high and easier-to-reach top-end speed. Ventilation on the mast is now a thing of the past. We paid particular attention to this detail, so no matter the sea state, ventilation on the mast's TE is significantly reduced. The HM105 has been optimised for racing. The thickness of the submerged part of the mast is a further 1mm thinner than the HM80 and HM85, to provide maximum top-end speed. As a result this mast is not for jumping.

The low-stretch Dyneema rope greatly reduces friction, and downhaul can be applied with just your hands on most Wave and X-Over sails. The extension ring has a simple to use Pop &amp; Slide system, so setting the right length becomes intuitive. The U-Pin button sits discreetly on the extension tube and has a manual locking function for safety and peace of mind, whether you’re in the waves or during long slalom reaches. High-grade plastic and stainless steel components ensure the extension will be in your quiver for many years to come.</p>

The Aluminium is our alternative to the Carbon, with the same innovative features. The MDM extension includes 4 oversized, low friction, easy thread, corrosion-resistant plastic pulleys, that line up perfectly with the sail. When combined with the low-stretch Dyneema rope, an 8-to-1 pulley ratio makes high-tension downhaul easier, allowing the finest adjustment with ease. The extension ring has a simple to use Pop &amp; Slide system, so setting the right length becomes intuitive.

9029323981141,North Slalom Foil,north-slalom-foil-2024,"<p>For wind foil racers, an evolution of what was already a first-of-its-kind sail, designed from the water up. Specific attention has been given to the conflicting needs of launching flight on the foil, and light handling in flight. Wherever you race, from the PWA to the Defi Wind to the next target in front of you, the North Slalom Foil is fast, stable in flight, and ultra reactive in the hands. For the next generation of this sail our focus has been on improving the pure top end speed, and making it easier for the rider to achieve this potential. Significant real and on-the-water weight savings help the sail to disappear in the hands leaving the rider to focus purely on trimming the foil and their board. Crafted with a 1 piece monocoque luff pocket and sail body, that is seamless and functions as a whole in the sail’s structure. The air cam system, combined with splitting batten pockets and battens, locks power in the sail and maximizes speed. Its soft rotation allows you to tighten your arc around the buoy, and take the inside track. A rapid power-up on the new tack gives you an amazing burst of acceleration.

Wherever you race, from the PWA to the Defi Wind to the next target in front of you, the North Slalom Foil is fast, stable in flight, and ultra reactive in the hands. For the next generation of this sail our focus has been on improving the pure top end speed, and making it easier for the rider to achieve this potential. Significant real and on-the-water weight savings help the sail to disappear in the hands leaving the rider to focus purely on trimming the foil and their board.

The air cam system, combined with splitting batten pockets and battens, locks power in the sail and maximizes speed.

Carbon ShiftLock handles are purchased separately from the wing, which makes it easy to find your perfect setup. There are five carbon handle lengths, from the single 1100 or 950 boom to the 500, 400, and 250 mm handles. Follow the size chart to determine the best handle combination for your wing size. If you're a more experienced rider and you know what you want, then you've got the option to either downsize or go for a boom. The boom is your lightest handle option. It only has two connection points, so the overall weight is lower than two separate handles with four mounts. This suits a rider wanting a lighter rig for lighter winds and larger wings. The boom is also the most cost-effective option and would suit any rider's ability; its more forgiving because it allows you to slide your hand up and down during tacks.

It has a higher aspect ratio than the S270, which means less drag, and the flatter rondure (front view) enables more manoeuvrability. The S238 is designed to match the new MA1200/MA1500 and larger HA front wings, giving your setup a faster and more responsive feel. </p>

<p>The North stabs are mounted on top of the fuselage, which helps them to avoid turbulence from the flow of the front wing, creating a smoother ride. This top mounting also gives the rider an early breach warning - the stab pierces the water surface first, giving you a better chance of recovery before your front wing gets too high. </p>

<p>Like the Front Wings, all Sonar Stabilizers are pre-preg carbon construction, ensuring optimal stiffness and direct performance. The thin profile section reduces drag, while the material properties help maintain structural integrity and rigidity. </p>

<p>Stabs have a huge influence on performance. As you progress to smaller wing sizes, we recommend changing to a smaller stabilizer to be more manoeuvrable.

8732605022549,Carve Kite,carve-kite,"<p>The Carve is a powerful, reactive and controllable kite, ideal for carving up a wave face, tucking into a barrel or boosting strapless tricks. Engineered with a stable, lower aspect ratio design for fast pivot turns and excellent drift, the Carve has an extremely direct feel in both bar pressure and steering initiation. For 2023, we've put the Carve back into its wave riding category. Refined bridling for a longer, more progressive travel means the kite feels smoother and more responsive throughout the full depower range. It is still reactive when you sheet out – to the very end. Improved overall balance also enhances drift, so when you're surfing, it glides down the line, waiting for your bar input. More intuitive control - especially when the kite's not visible on a big bottom turn, cut back, or in a barrel - means you can focus 100% on the surf. The Carve has a slightly reduced leading-edge diameter and thinned-out profiles. This gives the kite smoother power delivery, improves the high-end wind range, and helps you ride deeper in the pocket for longer. The kite won't pull you aggressively off the rail, and you'll have softer landings when doing big jumps. The 2023 Carve will also relaunch faster in critical situations. We've introduced lighter bladders in all sizes and a lighter 2-ply canopy reinforcement. This reduces weight and helps improve the turning speed in light wind while maintaining the Carve's surf-tough durability. The Carve now flies faster, generating more power and board speed. It rockets upwind. Experienced riders will benefit from the kite's impressive power and efficiency, while intermediate riders will find it offers a smoother, more user-friendly ride. Freeride and Strapless Freestylers will love the improved hangtime and catch for kite loops and softer landings.</p>",2023-07-24T02:37:12+02:00,2023-07-18T16:23:46+02:00,2025-02-22T07:52:14+01:00,North Kiteboarding,85000.230001,,47083373592917,10m / Rubine Red,10m,Rubine Red,NA,8715738778085,TRUE,TRUE,,FALSE,1072.00,0,1649.00,1,8732605022549,2023-07-18T16:23:48+02:00,2025-02-22T07:52:14+01:00,,

Refined bridling for a longer, more progressive travel means the kite feels smoother and more responsive throughout the full depower range. It is still reactive when you sheet out – to the very end. Improved overall balance also enhances drift, so when you're surfing, it glides down the line, waiting for your bar input. More intuitive control - especially when the kite's not visible on a big bottom turn, cut back, or in a barrel - means you can focus 100% on the surf. The Carve has a slightly reduced leading-edge diameter and thinned-out profiles. This gives the kite smoother power delivery, improves the high-end wind range, and helps you ride deeper in the pocket for longer. The kite won't pull you aggressively off the rail, and you'll have softer landings when doing big jumps. The 2023 Carve will also relaunch faster in critical situations. We've introduced lighter bladders in all sizes and a lighter 2-ply canopy reinforcement. This reduces weight and helps improve the turning speed in light wind while maintaining the Carve's surf-tough durability. The Carve now flies faster, generating more power and board speed. It rockets upwind. Experienced riders will benefit from the kite's impressive power and efficiency, while intermediate riders will find it offers a smoother, more user-friendly ride. Freeride and Strapless Freestylers will love the improved hangtime and catch for kite loops and softer landings.</p>",2023-07-24T02:37:12+02:00,2023-07-18T16:23:46+02:00,2025-02-22T07:52:14+01:00,North Kiteboarding,85000.230001,,47083373756757,11m / Pacific Blue,11m,Pacific Blue,NA,8715738778184,TRUE,TRUE,,FALSE,1124.00,0,1729.00,12,8732605022549,2023-07-18T16:23:48+02:00,2025-02-22T07:52:14+01:00,,

Our iconic premier 5-strut kite delivers incredible top-end control and allows you to hold down more power than any other kite per square metre. Big jumps. Big hang time. Big wind range. The Orbit rockets you upwind fast, with effortless steering, extreme boosting and hangtime guaranteed to take your breath away. Without changing the DNA of the kite, we've engineered it to feel smoother, lighter, faster, and even more predictable in the unpredictable. At North, we understand what riders want in a performance, big air kite. For 2023 the Orbit feels even more responsive in all conditions. We've made small structural refinements to smooth out the canopy, optimizing the profile for less drag, faster forward speed and smoother turning. Slightly refined bridling means the kite feels more stable and forgiving in overpowered, gusty conditions yet retains its ability to fly forward and catch you in kite loops. We've reduced the kite's overall weight with lighter bladders in larger sizes and introduced a new 2-ply canopy material reinforcement on the trailing edge. The lighter the kite, the faster the steering, the more lift it creates, and the higher you jump. We've constructed the leading edge and struts in our lighter N-Dure Dacron to save significantly more weight without compromising strength or durability. We've also introduced two additional bar pressure options so you can choose from a lighter, more forgiving feeling in cruise mode, right through to ultra-direct steering with shorter depower travel in megaloop mode. This new fourth setting gives you the confidence to loop the kite even lower. It is ideal for heavier riders on smaller kites and boosts wingtip support on those crazy 40knot + days.

Our iconic premier 5-strut kite delivers incredible top-end control and allows you to hold down more power than any other kite per square metre. Big jumps. Big hang time. Big wind range. The Orbit rockets you upwind fast, with effortless steering, extreme boosting and hangtime guaranteed to take your breath away. Without changing the DNA of the kite, we've engineered it to feel smoother, lighter, faster, and even more predictable in the unpredictable. At North, we understand what riders want in a performance, big air kite. For 2023 the Orbit feels even more responsive in all conditions. We've made small structural refinements to smooth out the canopy, optimizing the profile for less drag, faster forward speed and smoother turning. Slightly refined bridling means the kite feels more stable and forgiving in overpowered, gusty conditions yet retains its ability to fly forward and catch you in kite loops. We've reduced the kite's overall weight with lighter bladders in larger sizes and introduced a new 2-ply canopy material reinforcement on the trailing edge. The lighter the kite, the faster the steering, the more lift it creates, and the higher you jump. We've constructed the leading edge and struts in our lighter N-Dure Dacron to save significantly more weight without compromising strength or durability. We've also introduced two additional bar pressure options so you can choose from a lighter, more forgiving feeling in cruise mode, right through to ultra-direct steering with shorter depower travel in megaloop mode. This new fourth setting gives you the confidence to loop the kite even lower. It is ideal for heavier riders on smaller kites and boosts wingtip support on those crazy 40knot + days. Tested by nature, proven on the podium. The Orbit has your back when the rules of gravity don't apply.</p>

The 2024 Flex Pro are engineered to help absorb and disperse impact after gravity-defying boosts, with triple-density dynamic support technology to protect your heels and guarantee softer landings. We’ve added structure and stability with a contoured anatomical footbed and ramped chassis for improved fit and increased lateral support. Outer angled heel inserts ensure your foot rolls properly, providing a stable landing and protecting your knees and ankles when loading up to release into the air. The GripFlex lightweight, rubberized EVA inner maintains grip underfoot when wet, while the fine grip pattern helps keep you locked in on various angles, preventing your foot from sliding out of the binding. We’ve refined the adjustable injection-Velcro top flap to provide a strong yet flexible hold. The strap has a soft foam and KnitFlex seamless lining with split-Velcro fastenings. These provide custom comfort and allow your foot to shuffle more easily into a locked-in position. For your ultimate fit, ensure there's enough room for your toes to stretch and flex, and make sure the strap doesn't slip or rub. The upper should feel secure, but not too tight, and the footbed should match the shape of your foot. The Flex LX are compatible with both our 2023-2024 FlipTech centreline and 2020-2022 offline TwinTip mounting systems.

Intuitive control - especially when the kite's not visible on a big bottom turn, cut back, or in a barrel - means you can focus 100% on the surf.  The Carve has a longer, progressive travel, so feels smooth and responsive throughout the full depower range and when you sheet out, is reactive to the very end. For 2024, the Carve feels lighter, faster turning and more agile. We’ve redesigned the whole kite from top to bottom for better drift and more responsive fingertip-light steering. It has a lowered aspect ratio, new panel layout, refined leading edge and profile for more responsive steering and lighter bar pressure, more stable efficient drifting and less pull on the wave face. Improved overall balance with more sweep in the tips enhances drift, so when you're surfing, it glides down the line, waiting for your bar input. The wingtips are lighter, and we’ve introduced a smoother curve and more shape draft back, so the balance is more in the centre of the profile. A smaller LE diameter reduces the pulling power, while added sweep enables effortless roll to relaunch. The Carve is now much more smooth, stable and manageable in gusty conditions. The Carve flies fast upwind and experienced riders will benefit from the kite's impressive power and efficiency. Intermediate riders will find it offers a smoother, more user-friendly ride.

Our iconic premier 5-strut kite delivers incredible top-end control and allows you to hold down more power than any other kite per square metre. Big jumps. Big hang time. Big wind range. The Orbit rockets you upwind fast, with effortless steering, extreme boosting and hangtime guaranteed to take your breath away.  For 2024 we’ve smoothed out the shape of the LE, introducing a continuous curved arc that is slightly narrower in the shoulders and wider in the wingtips. It’s quick. The wingtips have a more bi-elliptical shape for reduced drag and faster turning speed, while a slightly deeper profile in the centre creates more lift. Changes to the wingtip inspired a fully reworked bridle and attachment point positioning, for the most stable Orbit yet. The kite feels even more reliable and forgiving in overpowered, gusty conditions yet retains its ability to fly forward and catch you in kite loops. It's intuitive. Riders of all abilities can experience the best of both worlds, without worrying about your kite’s position in the sky. It’s more responsive in all conditions. In the smaller sizes we’ve lowered the aspect ratio slightly and refined profiles for improved hangtime and a faster, tighter turning radius for the doubles and S-loops. In the bigger sizes we have updated the profiles for a more lively and reactive feel, with increased low end performance for heavier riders. We've also reduced the kite's overall weight with lighter bladders now in every size. Lighter weight means your kite flies faster, sooner, because you need less wind to get the kite up in the sky.

Developing these new material technologies has allowed us to create a stiffer, lighter and more durable wing without geometric compromise (and without the high-performance price tag). N-Weave 45 reduces structural deflection and transfers wind energy into greater forward speed, explosive boost and hangtime for freestyle tricks. We've specifically designed our new low-stretch, low-deflection Matrix N-HTRS high-tenacity canopy material to manage the added tension of the N-Weave 45 airframe, further increasing the wind range, and holding its shape in all conditions. The Mode has a fast, VMG-optimized design, which lets you sail closer to the wind, on higher upwind angles, and reduces your need to tack or gybe. We designed the Mode primarily for high-speed performance, but the stiffer airframe also translates into unprecedented loft for higher jumps and forward momentum on landings. With incredible high-end stability, the 3.5 to 4.8m are ideal for use in stronger winds, while the 5.5m and 6.8m are optimised for greater power in lighter air.

8732639920469,Track Skate Board,track-skate-board,"<p>Skate like you surf. We've designed our new Track urban surf-skate board to capture the feel of riding waves even when there are none.

8732636873045,Sonar Carbon Fuselage Screw Pack B2,sonar-carbon-fuselage-screw-pack-b2,"<p>Titanium countersunk screws to attach your Sonar Carbon Fuselage to your Sonar Mast. The Sonar Carbon Fuselage Screw Pack B2 (M8x30 TH CSK T40) is designed to fit Sonar Carbon Fuselage with tapered countersink holes. How to identify the correct screws for your carbon fuselage: More recent models of the Sonar Carbon Fuselage will have tapered countersink holes. These allow the head of a flathead screw to sit flush with the top of the fuselage. Tapered holes = Screw Pack B2. If your carbon fuselage has tapered holes (similar to your Sonar front wing) you will require the Sonar Fuselage Screw Pack B2 (M8x30 TH CSK T40 - 85009.240145). Straight holes = Screw Pack B. Some earlier models of the Sonar Carbon Fuselage, and all aluminium models of the Sonar Fuselage do not have countersink holes, so will require Sonar Fuselage Pack B (M8x35 THCS T40 with M8 Washer - 85009.200136). Note: If you have an earlier Carbon or an aluminium Fuselage, and you wish to use it with an HM Mast, you will need to swap to the 25mm B3 Screw Pack supplied with the HM Masts.</p>",2023-07-22T04:00:58+02:00,2023-07-18T16:29:34+02:00,2025-02-22T07:52:16+01:00,North Kiteboarding,85009.240145,,47083422286165,O/S / Black,O/S,Black,NA,8715738823402,TRUE,TRUE,,TRUE,12.99,0,NA,1,8732636873045,2023-07-18T16:29:34+02:00,2025-02-22T07:52:16+01:00,,

Ideal for riders wanting more from surf and downwind swells (with or without a wing). The foils insensitivity to angle of attack change forgiveness means you don’t have to be an expert or have perfect pumping technique. A refined balance of roll stability and manoeuvrability gives you confidence during pumping and take-offs, and the ability to initiate powerful rail-to-rail carves. Push it harder, lip stall and lay down banking turns, knowing tip ventilation is a thing of the past. Reduced distance between the mast and front wing makes for faster, tighter pivoting turns. We’ve kept the span similar between the three sizes, providing the same ride feel across the entire size range. The SF promises that frictionless sensation of glide at slower speeds. Responsive and agile. With intuitive recovery. Wakesurfing ten waves back, prone-surfing, wing-surfing, pumping or mastering the downwind. The Sonar SF Series.

7575169302700,Sonar S178 Stabilizer,sonar-s178-stabilizer,"<p></p><p>Flat, loose and even faster, the new S178 Stabilizer is a high speed upgrade to the Sonar Foil System for experienced riders. We recommend pairing the S178 with Front Wing size HA950, or smaller. The S178 has a higher aspect ratio than the S208, which means less drag, and the flatter rondure (front view) enables more manoeuvrability. </p>

<p>As we’ve increased our front wing range, we’ve needed to match the lift force of the front wing with the stabilizer. While your front wing creates vertical lift, your stabilizer has a downward acting force, which prevents the front wing from nose-diving. A larger stabilizer translates into more front foot pressure, while a smaller stabilizer equals less front foot pressure.</p>

<p>The North stabs are mounted on top of the fuselage, which helps them to avoid turbulence from the flow of the front wing, creating a smoother ride. This top mounting also gives the rider an early breach warning - the stab pierces the water surface first, giving you a better chance of recovery before your front wing gets too high. </p>

<p>Like the Front Wings, all Sonar Stabilizers are pre-preg carbon construction, ensuring optimal stiffness and direct performance. The thin profile section reduces drag, while the material properties help maintain structural integrity and rigidity. </p>

7412796883116,Sonar S208 Stabilizer,sonar-s208-stabilizer,"<p>Flat, loose and fast, the new S208 Stabilizer is another high performance upgrade to the Sonar Foil System for experienced riders. The S208 has a higher aspect ratio than the S210, which means less drag, and the flatter rondure (front view) enables more manoeuvrability. As we’ve increased our front wing range, we’ve needed to match the lift force of the front wing with the stabilizer. While your front wing creates vertical lift, your stabilizer has a downward acting force, which prevents the front wing from nose-diving. A larger stabilizer translates into more front foot pressure, while a smaller stabilizer equals less front foot pressure. The North stabs are mounted on top of the fuselage, which helps them to avoid turbulence from the flow of the front wing, creating a smoother ride. This top mounting also gives the rider an early breach warning - the stab pierces the water surface first, giving you a better chance of recovery before your front wing gets too high. Like the Front Wings, all Sonar Stabilizers are pre-preg carbon construction, ensuring optimal stiffness and direct performance. The thin profile section reduces drag, while the material properties help maintain structural integrity and rigidity. Stabs have a huge influence on performance. As you progress to smaller wing sizes, we recommend changing to a smaller stabilizer to be more manoeuvrable. Experienced riders will really feel the difference. A new tail can have a big impact on your style.</p>",2022-10-05T08:41:13+02:00,2022-08-11T01:28:32+02:00,2025-02-22T07:52:16+01:00,North Kiteboarding,85004.230094,,41904173023404,208 cm² / Black,208 cm²,Black,NA,8715738784802,TRUE,TRUE,,FALSE,189.00,0,NA,1,7412796883116,2022-08-11T01:28:39+02:00,2025-02-22T07:52:16+01:00,,

The smaller the wing, the less planing surface = less lift and higher stall speed.  The HA Series Wings are designed for lighter / more experienced riders to foil in faster-moving ocean swells.</p>",2022-10-04T01:58:47+02:00,2022-08-09T10:09:56+02:00,2025-02-22T07:52:16+01:00,North Kiteboarding,85004.230106,,41894868975788,1150 cm² / Black,1150 cm²,Black,NA,8715738784772,TRUE,TRUE,,TRUE,669.00,0,NA,1,7411145244844,2022-08-09T10:10:04+02:00,2025-02-22T07:52:16+01:00,,

With incredible high-end stability, the 4.2 and 5.5m are ideal for use in stronger winds, while the 7m is optimised for greater power in lighter air. The wing has a balanced lower aspect ratio with rounded wingtips to reduce tip strike, and the new panel layout delivers wingtip stability and increased tension under load. Featuring rigid GripLock micro-trim control handles for immediate response, and new race-window positioning to help you keep a close eye on your opponents.</p>",2022-09-19T06:24:43+02:00,2022-08-09T09:50:27+02:00,2025-02-22T07:52:16+01:00,North Kiteboarding,85000.230006,,41894810910892,7m / White,7m,White,NA,8715738781641,TRUE,TRUE,,TRUE,1085.00,0,1550.00,3,7411135807660,2022-08-09T09:50:40+02:00,2025-02-22T07:52:16+01:00,,

Engineered to help absorb and disperse impact after gravity-defying boosts, with triple-density dynamic support technology to protect your heels and guarantee softer landings. We’ve added structure and stability with a more contoured footbed and ramped chassis for improved fit and increased lateral support. Outer angled heel inserts ensure your foot rolls properly, providing a stable landing and protecting your knees and ankles when loading up to release into the air. The GripFlex lightweight, rubberized EVA inner maintains grip underfoot when wet, while the fine grip pattern helps keep you locked in on various angles, preventing your foot from sliding out of the binding. We’ve refined the adjustable injection-Velcro top flap to provide a strong yet flexible hold. The strap has a soft foam and KnitFlex seamless lining with split-Velcro fastenings. These provide custom comfort and allow your foot to shuffle more easily into a locked-in position. For your ultimate fit, ensure there's enough room for your toes to stretch and flex, and make sure the strap doesn't slip or rub. The upper should feel secure, but not too tight, and the footbed should match the shape of your foot. The Flex LX are compatible with both our new 2023 FlipTech centreline and 2020-2022 offline TwinTip mounting systems.

Smooth and powerful down the line, turning hard in the pocket and releasing on-demand, the Charge is a high-performance surfboard. It is a fast, dedicated surf shape with loads of projection for a powerful vertical attack in larger waves. The Charge also excels at carving, driving upwind, onshore riding, and is versatile enough for aerial tricks. Our Carbon Innegra Futurelite construction maximises the board’s strength, without losing flex or responsiveness, while the DualShock EVA inserts increases its durability and protects from heel dents. Refined in 2023 for improved response, speed and drive, the new Charge delivers an even smoother, more powerful ride with a positive feel and more radical turns. Feedback from riders charging some of the world’s biggest waves led to us making very slight refinements to the shape to improve the handling at speed and drive through the turns. We've moved the wide point of the board slightly forward, and we've increased the concave under the front foot. We've also reshaped the rounded surf rails to be lower and more refined, giving the board more grip when you’re carving the wave face.

But conditions and user preference may change what stabilizer angle feels the best (aka the sweet spot). Shimming changes the angle of attack (AOA) and controls the amount of downforce the stabilizer creates on the overall foil system - to increase the stabilizer AOA and front foot pressure, add positive shim. The smallest tweak in the AOA can improve comfort, reduce fatigue, change the cadence of your pump or the turning radius of your carve and increase/decrease your front and rear foot pressure without changing your foot position. With the Sonar Shim Kit you can stack multiple shims, from our base setting it covers from -0.5 to +2.5 degrees. Finetune the way your foil system performs and change the way you ride.

Highly efficient with great lift, speed, glide and pumpability in flat or choppy water.

The short chord length defines the profile thickness, and with a thin profile comes reduced drag. The span gives you stability, with a slightly longer radius turn than a lower aspect ratio wing of the same size.</p>",2022-01-19T23:37:57+01:00,2022-01-19T23:37:59+01:00,2025-02-22T07:52:16+01:00,North Kiteboarding,85004.220082,,41071775318188,1450 cm² / Black,1450 cm²,Black,NA,8715738766365,TRUE,TRUE,,TRUE,409.00,0,629.00,1,7146797760684,2022-01-19T23:38:02+01:00,2025-02-22T07:52:16+01:00,,

Exceptional efficiency and pumpability allows you connect wave after wave when prone or SUP foil surfing. It’s high wingspan to chord length ratio and relatively thin profile is similar to a sailplane glider wing. With this style of wing, you generate maximum efficiency and lift. The short chord length defines the profile thickness, and with a thin profile comes reduced drag. The span gives you stability, with a slightly longer radius turn than a lower aspect ratio wing of the same size.

Also a true crossover wing, the 1850R has more lift than the 1500R. In smaller to medium waves, prone foil surfers can perfect shorter radius surf-style turns with ease. Great for wing-foiling in all conditions and perfect for learning to foil, the 1850R is also still kite-able. Featuring our new, patent-pending reflexed-camber foil section design to give the wing pitch stability and prevent your board’s tendency to nose up strongly when you first get going. This eliminates the need for you to change your position to trim the board as you speed up, or as you drop-in on a wave. The 1850R has a relatively large surface area, which makes it highly controllable, with incredible roll and pitch stability. Usually, a large wing means more drag, hence less speed.

7111917764780,Sonar 1500R Front Wing,sonar-1500r-front-wing,"<p>The Sonar 1500R is a true crossover wing with real performance across every foiling discipline. So stable, you’ll feel like you’re like standing on the ground. The 1500R is great for prone foil surfing in medium to large waves, has a smooth carvy feel and fits nicely in the pocket. Its predictable lift gives you time to find a comfortable stance without fighting to keep the nose down as the foil accelerates. So you’re able to remain in the same position over the entire speed range. The balance of the foil system means you can place your back foot further behind the mast, letting you ride the board more like a shortboard. Our new, patent-pending reflexed-camber foil section design gives the wing pitch stability and prevents your board’s tendency to nose up strongly when you first get going. Thus, it eliminates the need for you to change your position to trim the board as you speed up, or as you drop-in on a wave. The Sonar reflexed wings have a relatively large surface area, which makes them highly controllable, with incredible roll and pitch stability. Usually, a large wing means more drag, hence less speed. But because you can position the reflexed wings on the fuselage with a lower angle of attack, they feel smaller than they are in terms of their speed range and responsiveness. A reflexed wing gives you impressive control throughout the entire speed range, with extreme top-end speeds unheard of for a wing that size.</p>",2021-12-21T12:58:00+01:00,2021-12-21T12:58:02+01:00,2025-02-22T07:52:16+01:00,North Kiteboarding,85010.210077,,40941531103404,1500 cm² / Black,1500 cm²,Black,NA,8715738701939,TRUE,TRUE,,TRUE,344.00,0,529.00,1,7111917764780,2021-12-21T12:58:09+01:00,2025-02-22T07:52:16+01:00,,

Some earlier models of the Sonar Carbon Fuselage do not have countersunk holes, so will require this Screw Pack B (M8x35 TH CS). Newer models of the Sonar Carbon Fuselage will have tapered countersink holes. These allow the head of a flathead screw to sit flush with the top of the fuselage.  Tapered holes = Screw Pack B2. If your carbon fuselage has tapered holes (similar to your Sonar front wing) you will require the Sonar Fuselage Screw Pack B2 (M8x30 TH CSK T40 - 85009.240145). If you are wanting to attach an HM Carbon Mast to your Aluminium or earlier model carbon fuselage with straight holes, you will need Sonar Fuselage Screw Pack B3 (M8x25 TH CS). Please see the Size Chart for details.</p>

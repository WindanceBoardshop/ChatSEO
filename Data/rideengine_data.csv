This layer not only ensures good traction but also offers superior UV protection and helps prevent accidental punctures. Additionally, the Pro model features our new TPU molded handles, which are our proprietary design. These handles are tall and easy to grab, with just the right amount of flex, providing an exceptional level of functionality and comfort.</p>
<p>The Ride Engine PWC Inflatable Collar stands out as a custom-designed solution, meticulously crafted to match the specific dimensions of your PWC. Constructed using durable and UV-resistant PVC, this inflatable collar serves the dual purpose of enhancing watercraft stability while preserving agility and maneuverability. Moreover, it offers an additional layer of protection and safety for riders who may come into contact with the PWC during rider acquisition along with providing crucial impact protection for the watercraft itself.</p>

However, perhaps the most critical component required to get on the water -the pump- has remained unchanged since the days of flip phones. Not anymore. Gone are the times of struggling with manual pumping, thanks to the Air Box: Ride Engine's rechargeable electric pump. Engineered alongside a top electric pump manufacturer, the Air Box has a powerful two-stage system that automatically switches from low-pressure, high-volume pumping to high-pressure, low-volume delivering the fastest inflation possible.</p>
<p>Eliminate the worry of over or under inflating your gear when you set your desired air pressure on the Air Box. The smart inflation technology has real-time pressure monitoring, ensuring an automatic shut-off once the pump reaches the selected pressure. Powered by a lithium-ion battery cell, it can inflate four to six kites or wings, and three SUPs on a single charge.</p>

The Vinaka's ultra-minimal, no-BS design of ripstop nylon and thin closed-cell foam weighs in at a mere 450 grams, so you can still fully enjoy the free feeling of wing foiling. With a shadow-like fit and sliding hook, the Vinaka virtually disappears when swimming, paddling, or riding toeside (situations where a traditional kite or windsurf harness can be a massive hassle/pain/annoyance). If you want to extend your wing foiling sessions, the Vinaka will help you stay out on the water when everyone else that's winging must head in because their arms are smoked.</p>",2023-03-10T09:35:24-08:00,2022-07-15T16:41:04-07:00,2025-02-21T22:48:44-08:00,Ride Engine,Harnesses,,39818595074182,XL / Grey Camo,XL,Grey Camo,NA,3231518017,TRUE,TRUE,,TRUE,99.00,4536,154.00,8,6747258126470,2022-07-15T16:41:04-07:00,2025-02-21T22:48:44-08:00,,
